# README

Things to cover:
* Completed on Windows 32-bit
* Ruby version: 2.3.3
* Rails version 5.1.3gemspec
* RStudio with PostgreSQL and DBI packages
* PostgreSQL 9.5
* Database created in pgAdminIII

Created web application and database with Ruby/rails through PostgreSQL, uploaded csv to database, called database in R for tests, modified database files for web application through Ruby/rails, edited web application files in Notepad++, uploaded files to Github with Git Bash

The database for this project is "myapp_development". There are extra controllers, models, and views from my personal practice that are not used for this project. 

Please note that on my computer, the file name is called ...Sites/myapp, not rowanapp. This will probably need to be changed after download to get images from the folder for the web app design. 
Another note, I was not able to save my R file, so I copied the code into a .docx and have uploaded it to the main "Rowan App" folder here. Part of the analsyis was done in excel and that file can also be found in the main folder.
